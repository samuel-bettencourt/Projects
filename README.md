# Projects
This is a pygame project that is supposed to accurately model collisions between circular objects according to kinematics and dynamics.
The game is a version of shuffleboard or olympic curling where the goal is to get closer to the bullseye than the other team.
The collisions are supposed to model elastic collisions between equal mass objects.
The collisions conserve momentum (velocity is actual conserved quantity since equal mass objects involved in collisions).
